      Not hungry?
      </header>
      <p>When you have been eating a lot of peanut butter, your stomach can sometimes send a false signal to your brain that you aren't hungry.  We call this feeling "lazy belly."</p><p>Peanut butter holds lots of essential nutrients, including fat, carbs, and protein.  It's important to let your stomach know that it's complaints won't affect your peanut butter intake.  In order to put your stomach in it's place, consume extra peanut butter anytime your stomach tells you to stop.  If your stomach hasn't told you to stop, then of course you can keep eating anyways.  Just shovel it in there with a spoon and you'll be well on your way.

        Here is a basic stomach-shushing process that you can use:<br><br>
<li><code>Receive whiny, pathetic input from underachieving stomach</code></li>
<li><code>Grab spatula</code></li>
<li><code>Whack stomach with spatula. "Bad stomach!" </code></li>
  <li><code>Rub stomach and apologize. "I'll never hurt you again."</code></li>
    <li><code>Continue shoveling peanut butter into your mouth.</code></li>
